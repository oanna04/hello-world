# hello-world

Hi there,

I started to learn online web development with almost zero knowleadge of CSS, HTML or JavaScipt and along the way I discovered how creative and chalanging coding can be. I also love to travel and I hope to find a remote job that will allow me to have the location freedom that I always dreamt of.

Happy coding!
